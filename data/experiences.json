Hatsumai has, in my opinion, the <span class=\"highlight\">cleanest UI I’ve created</span>, along with a <span class=\"highlight\">well-organized backend</span> that greatly improves <span class=\"highlight\">scalability and maintainability</span>. I also wanted to improve on Proj.ai by implementing a <span class=\"highlight\">user authentication system</span>, allowing users to <span class=\"highlight\">sign in and view previously generated projects</span>.
