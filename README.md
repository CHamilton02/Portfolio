# Portfolio Website

This portfolio website is built using TypeScript, SCSS, and Vue.js, with animations powered by libraries like TypeIt.

Currently, experience data is stored in a public folder and accessed via Axios and Pinia. In the future, I plan to implement a small backend to manage this data dynamically.
